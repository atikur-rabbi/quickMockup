QuickMockup is a simple tool for creating simple mockups of interfaces and websites.

**NOTE**
This is currently under development and infrastructural work in order to put forward a version of quickMockup. titled quickMockup v2,
that takes advantage of more recent and stable technologies and standards. quickMockup v2 will as well try to address and provide
solutions to the elementary issues with the previous version, such as zooming, user-composed elements, save to more formats and many
other featurs.

**[Live demo](http://quickmocup-v2-demo.herokuapp.com/)**

If you are looking for the older version, it is pointed at by [v0.x](https://github.com/jdittrich/quickMockup/tree/v0.x) branch.
And the old live demo is under the (same old) url https://jdittrich.github.io/quickMockup

--------------------

## Usecase

The tool is meant to allow to *quickly* create mockups of interfaces in order to *communicate* ideas.

It is *not* meant for pixel perfect mockups nor for complex interface mockups involving several screens and hundereds of elements.

The target group for now are interaction/interface *designers* or design-aware *developers* who take part in open source projects and need to communicate their ideas. An mockup is worth a thousand words in this case.
